# 🎙️ Voice-Based AI Assistant (Gemini + Speech Recognition)

This project is a **voice-controlled AI assistant** built with Python. It listens to your speech, processes your query using **Google’s Gemini Generative AI**, and responds with both **spoken** and **textual** answers. The assistant can handle technical, creative, story-based, and biographical questions intelligently.
